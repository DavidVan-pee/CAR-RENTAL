            <h1>Nissan Altima</h1>
            <p>The Altima is a good mid-sized car with powerful engines, excellent fuel economy, a relaxed ride, and comfortable seating. It can also handle winter roads and features a 9.6 out of 10 safety rating</p>
            <p>If you are searching for a mid-sized sedan, you have likely come across the Altima, which Nissan says is the company’s “all-time best-selling vehicle in the U.S.” This vehicle is unique because it's Nissans first sedan that offers all-wheel drive, which makes it a good choice for commuters and families in snowy locations.

                The Nissan Altima falls in the middle-to-low end of the pack compared with other vehicles in its class, but it’s known for its excellent fuel economy and a roomy, comfortable interior. The vehicle, which was fully redesigned in 2019, is available in a variety of trims to fit your needs and budget.</p>
